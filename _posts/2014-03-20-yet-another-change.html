Was on tour this week and Meflin commented upon the proposal requesting a change in project title. I was asked to put the sub organization name first in the project title. <br /><br />I got stuck without a computer&nbsp;nor a good internet nor a melange compatible browser. However managed to acquire apk of the UC Browser from a friend and changed the title to GNU Mailman Commandline Client.
