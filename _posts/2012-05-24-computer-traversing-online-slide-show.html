One of my relatives got placed in ****** recently.As part of his training,he is to view a set of slide shows that are hosted online.The time intervals are monitored so as to make sure that the slides are not just &nbsp;clicked away.<br /><br />Upon hearing all this,I thought of a solution for this,in case I end up in such a condition,especially if the slide show is boring and worthless!.(I have not seen his slide show,so I don't know whether it is good or bad :-) ).I googled to check for tools available to move mouse pointer on screen and to click.I came up with the solution,a package named <b>xdotool</b>,available under ubuntu linux(<b>sudo apt-get install xdotool</b>).<br /><br />It provides a number of mouse functions like:<br /><b>getmouseposition</b><br /><b>mousemove</b><br />and ofcourse <b>click</b><br /><br />Along with the above said linux power,I blended the simplicity of python to develop a code to do what I needed.<br /><br />Here is an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-best-facebook-campaigns-that-wont-be-seen-in-america-2012-5#in-puerto-rico-axe-put-qr-codes-in-mens-bathrooms-that-revealed-a-virtual-peephole-into-the-womens-bathroom-3" target="_blank">online slideshow</a> in which I tested the program.Just run the code,follow instructions and leave the computer to itself :-)!!!<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4595098.js"></script>
