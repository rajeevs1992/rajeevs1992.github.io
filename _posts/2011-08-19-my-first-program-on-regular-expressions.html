Today was a great day in my life.....I did my first program in regular expressions using python and I was dumbstruck on seeing the power of the RE engine(of python,I haven't used others)<br /><br />The code which was just intended to be a simple starter worked like a charm...The program prints the MAC ID of the machine on which it was run.If not with RE,it would have taken whole night.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4595140.js"></script><br />
