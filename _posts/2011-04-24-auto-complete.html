<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b>W</b><i>ell,I am not sure if my new code can be called an auto-complete program...It is more basically a dynamic search that searches an array(array in this case.I am working upon files,bound to succeed shortly) just as we type in the string that we intend to search.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i><a href="https://gist.github.com/4595160">Auto-complete-Backspace support added!</a></i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>The main part or soul of the code is the getch() function,which keeps on amazing me for the past few months.The potential and applicability of the function is just wonderful.Another great success is the finding of ASCII equivalent of backspace,without which the aim of my code would have been absurd.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>As always I am adding this code on to my +2 project which is now on its way to 4th version.But it is bound to take time...</i></div>
