At last I am upto some good.I made into the git repository team in our college,intended in creating a&nbsp;centralized&nbsp;repository server for the&nbsp;college&nbsp;projects.The project seemed simple at start and now we are convinced that there is a huge amount of&nbsp;hard-work&nbsp;behind every website on the net.<br /><br />Our team of three is working real hard in creating a good platform for hosting projects on a centralized server,making it easy for teachers to evaluate individual work/contribution to each project.This is necessary because of the practice of mere copying of project is prevalent everywhere.&nbsp;Of course&nbsp;<a href="http://www.github.com/">github</a>&nbsp;is the best option to manage versions commits etc.But our mentor cum HOD wanted the college to have its own central version control system.So we are on it from then on.<br /><br />Now about the project.It is basically a website(web&nbsp;application&nbsp;to be precise),hence involves web designing for the front end and a stable backend script that makes things happen.The backend is mainly done with help of PHP5 and databases using MySQL.Complex net applications like emails are easy to be implemented in python.Hence <a href="http://pastebin.com/wgEXcSJ3">confirmation mail</a>&nbsp;delivery post registration is sent using a python script.All git actions are (to be) put up as buttons and they are to be run behind the screen using exec.The code is almost fully in PHP.All password are SHA1 encrypted hence maintaining the privacy of users.Even the site administrator cant read users passwords.User inputs are filtered to prevent MySQL injection.<br /><br />And finally,the project is opensource and the <a href="http://www.github.com/rajeevs1992/lag">complete source code</a> is available in github.Anyone is free to use it for their own purpose.Also,this is a venture by a team of beginners,including me.Hence any serious flaws or mistakes must be brought to our notice.
